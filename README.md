# Biotech-MLEng-Coding-Task
Coding task for an application as ML Engineer in a Biotech startup.

The file ML_Engineer_coding_task.ipynb is the report of the coding task for the position of Machine Learning Engineer at a Biotech startup.

The Notebook is designed to run all the cells sequentially without the need for modifying anything in the code.

The code makes use of some libraries listed in the file requirements.txt. The file environment.yml contains the environment used to create the code. It can be installed with:

$conda env create -f environment.yml

If encountering any problem installing the environment from file, it is possible to create a clean virtual environment using:

$conda create -n ENV_NAME

with ENV_NAME arbitrary name, activating the new environment with:

$conda activate ENV_NAME

and installing all the dependencies using:

$pip install -r requirements.txt

or launching the notebook as it is, using for example jupyter lab, and use the first executable cell at the end of the introduction section to install all the required libraries in the current Jupyter kernel.

If encountering any issue, please contact the author at sicurellaemanuele@gmail.com.
